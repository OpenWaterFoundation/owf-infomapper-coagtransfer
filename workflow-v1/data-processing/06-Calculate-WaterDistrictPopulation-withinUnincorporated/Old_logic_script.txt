For urban districts, the population of the district within unincorporated county areas is based on land area 
#     multiplied by a proximal municipality's population density.  The logic is as follows (THIS MAY NEED TO BE 
#     REVISED BASED ON INPUT FROM WESTWATER RESEARCH):
# Arapahoe County Water and Wastewater Authority, East Cherry Creek Valley WSD, Inverness WSD will use Centennial
# Castle Pines North Metro District, Louviers WSD, and Roxborough WSD will use Larkspur (has increasing pop density)
# Centennial WSD will use Littleton (Arapahoe County)
# Cherokee Metro District will use Colorado Springs
# Consolidated Mutual Water Company will use Morrison
# Cottonwood WSD, Parker WSD, and Denver Southeast Suburban WSD will use Greenwood Village (has increasing pop density)
# Donala WSD and Woodmoor WSD No. 1 will use Colorado Springs
# Forest View Acres WD will use Palmer Lake
# North Table Mountain WSD will use Wheat Ridge
# Pueblo West MD will use Boulder County unincorporated area.  Even though Pueblo is much closer, its density 
# results in really high population numbers for Pueblo West.  Used an iterative process to determine Boulder Co.'s 
# density was appropriate.
# Security WD will use Colorado Springs
# South Adams County WSD will use Deer Trail

# Create separate datasets as needed and then will merge back together
