# Colorado Agricultural Water Transfer #

This website provides information about agricultural water transfer in Colorado,
currently focusing on transfers in the Colorado Front Range.

Colorado's Front Range continues to experience population growth.
The Front Range population added approximately 600,000 people in the decade from 2000 to 2010
and is projected to add another 3 million people in the next four decades.
The projected growth means that the Front Range population will have doubled from 2000 to 2050.

In the past, significant agricultural dry-up has occurred along the Front Range,
with the transfer of water supplies from agricultural to urban use, to fulfill the needs of population growth and development.
There is a growing sentiment among Colorado water leaders that we
cannot grow in the future the way that we have grown in the past.
There are options as to how fast urbanization occurs and to what extent the dry up of agricultural lands transpires.
Options include denser growth, changes in water dedications,
and flexibility in assuring municipal water supplies and reserves.

In partnership with the [Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)](https://www.edf.org/),
[WestWater Research (WWR)](https://www.waterexchange.com/)
evaluated economic aspects of Alternative Water Transfer Methods (ATMs).
This work has contributed important insights into the challenges and opportunities for ATM development in Colorado.
The primary state policy objective behind ATMs is to reduce the permanent
dry-up of agricultural lands due to municipal water supply acquisitions,
particularly along the Colorado Front Range, which has high population growth and agricultural production.
An important aspect of understanding the opportunity for ATMs is to understand
the drivers behind municipal growth and water acquisitions.
In 2018, WWR worked with EDF to develop an analysis of municipal growth and municipal
water supply shortages for the Front Range to the year 2050.
The analysis was both a water balance of individual municipal water providers and a spatial analysis to
map what land development and agricultural dry-up might look like under various future scenarios.
The analysis provided a better understanding of both the opportunity and benefits of ATMs for the Front Range.

While the analysis provided a better understanding of ATMs,
it also required estimates about future population growth, land development,
and municipal water supplies that are inherently difficult to predict.
There is a broader and more powerful benefit to be gained from the analytical tools developed by
WWR by creating a public and open dashboard for evaluating alternative futures for the Front Range.
An online dashboard with maps and charts can allow any user to simulate municipal growth,
land development, and agricultural dry-up for the Front Range.

In 2019, the [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org/)
began the next phase of the project,
represented in this website and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-ag-urban-workflow).
OWF has automating the original WWR analysis and implementing this initial website to publish the results.
This website uses the [InfoMapper](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/) tool developed by OWF.
The resulting tool can be implemented for other locations and the analysis
can be enhanced to consider more data inputs.
