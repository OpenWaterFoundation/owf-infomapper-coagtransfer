# Conservation Easements

Conservation easements are a mechanism by which land is
protected from future development.
For example, the owner of a farm may accept payment to place a conservation easement on the property,
in which case the farm cannot be developed.
Tax benefits can be realized if the conserved land is donated to a land trust or government agency. 
Conservation easements can restrict which agricultural lands can be considered when transferring water to other uses,
such as municipal use.

**The analysis presented on this web site did not consider conservation easements to constrain the agricultural water transfer analysis.**
