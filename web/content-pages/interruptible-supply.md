# Interruptible Supply Agreements

Interruptible Water Supply Agreements (IWSAs) allow for temporary water transfers,
for example to transfer water from agriculture to municipal use during a drought.
There are limits on how many years such an arrangement can be used,
for example 3 in 10 years.

**The analysis presented on this web site did not consider using IWSAs to temporarily meet municipal water demand.**
