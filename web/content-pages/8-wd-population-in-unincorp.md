# Baseline Scenario / Water District Population within Unincorporated Areas

To calculate the water district service population within unincorporated county land,
it is assumed that the unincorporated portion of a water district's population can be set
as a constant proportion of the associated county's unincorporated population.
This is the same assumption used for calculating municipal population as a proportion of the county population.

The proportion of a water district's developed land within
intersecting unincorporated county land that is also developed is multiplied by the
intersecting unincorporated county population estimates up to 2050 to estimate
the population of the water district within the associated unincorporated county.
