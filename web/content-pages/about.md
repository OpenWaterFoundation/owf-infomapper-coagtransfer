# About the Colorado Agricultural Water Transfer Project and Website #

This website has been developed by the [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org),
which is a nonprofit social enterprise that develops open source software and open data solutions
to make better decisions about water.

The Colorado Agricultural Water Transfer website provides access to cross-jurisdictional
datasets and visualizations related to agricultural water transfer in Colorado.
The initial website focuses on datasets and analysis related to
agricultural water transfers in the Colorado Front Range,
based on work completed by [WestWater Research (WWR)](https://www.waterexchange.com/)
with financial support of the [Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)](https://www.edf.org/).
Some additional resources are included in ***Supporting Data*** information products in order to
point out limitations in the analysis and need for additional analysis.

This website and content published on the website use the following software:

* [InfoMapper](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/infomapper/latest/doc-user) - OWF open source map-based information tool
* [GeoProcessor](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/geoprocessor/latest/doc-user/) - OWF open source spatial data processing tool built on QGIS
* [TSTool](http://opencdss.state.co.us/opencdss/tstool/) - OpenCDSS software to process time series into useful products

The content and workflow for the project is available in the
[owf-infomapper-coagtransfer](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer) GitHub repository.

**This website is a demonstration.  Additional features will be added in the future.**
