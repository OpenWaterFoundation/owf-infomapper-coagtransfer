# Baseline Scenario / Water District Land Growth

Annual land area development (growth) estimates for water districts were made
by taking the water district population change from year to year and applying an estimated population density.
Water districts are split by municipality and county as needed.
The cumulative amount of new growth and the total amount
of land area of each water district for each year is calculated.

District build-out was considered for those districts that cannot expand any further;
in these cases it was assumed that population growth occurs through increased population density.
