# Baseline Scenario / Population Density
 
Population density (persons per square mile) for each municipality is calculated using the municipality area and 2018 population.

Municipalities that exist in multiple counties have separate population densities for each
municipality/county part.

The calculated values are associated with the raster layer representation of municipalities.
