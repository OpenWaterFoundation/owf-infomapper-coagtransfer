# Baseline Scenario / Municipal Land Growth
 
Annual municipal land area development (growth) estimates are made by
taking the municipal population change from year to year and applying an estimated population density.
Population density is estimated to increase as municipalities grow and urbanize.
Categories of "Low", "Medium", and "High" are used to describe the density assumptions.

The cumulative amount of new growth and the total amount of land area of each municipality for each year is calculated.
Municipalities are split by county as needed.

Municipal build-out is considered for municipalities that cannot
expand any further; in these cases it is assumed that population growth occurs through increased population density.
