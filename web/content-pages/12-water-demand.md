# Baseline Scenario / Water Demand 

Municipal and water district water demand is calculated as population
multiplied by water use estimates in the form of gallons per capita per day (GPCD).
Amounts are converted to acre-feet per year.
GPCD estimates as compiled from water supply reports were considered 'normal' estimates.
Two other GPCD estimates, categorized as 'efficient' and 'inefficient' were considered.
An efficient GPCD was calculated as the normal GPCD multiplied by 0.85.
An inefficient GPCD was calculated as the normal GPCD multiplied by 1.15.
