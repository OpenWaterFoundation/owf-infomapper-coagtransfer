# Baseline Scenario / Water District Population within Municipalities

Water districts often serve populations that are within municipalities,
and a proportion of the district's service area may also be contained within unincorporated county land.

To estimate water district populations,
the amount of population that is within a municipality is first estimated,
followed by the amount within unincorporated areas.
The water district service population within a municipality is estimated
as the pro-rata portion of the municipal land area within the water district.
For example, a water district intersecting 22% of a municipal developed area
is allocated 22% of that municipality's population.
The associated municipality's population is subsequently adjusted to account for this
population in Step 9 so that there is not a double-counting of population.
