# Baseline Scenario / Population Checks

This step is a data check on the population calculations from previous steps.
Municipal population estimates calculated in Step 2 and adjusted in Step 9
are summed with water district population estimates calculated in Step 7 and Step 8.
The summed population numbers are compared to the county population estimates from DOLA.
