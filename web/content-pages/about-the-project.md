# About the Colorado Agricultural Water Transfer Project #

The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise
that develops open source software and open data solutions to make better decisions about water.

The Colorado Agricultural Water Transfer website provides access to cross-jurisdictional
datasets and visualizations related to agricultural water transfer in Colorado.
The initial website focuses on datasets and analysis related to
agricultural water transfers in the Colorado Front Range,
based on work completed by [WestWater Research (WWR)](https://www.waterexchange.com/)
with financial support of the [Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)](https://www.edf.org/).
