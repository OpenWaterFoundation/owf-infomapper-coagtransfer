## Overview

The Municipality Population map provides population information about Colorado municipalities.
Click on a municipality marker and then view its estimated historical population
and population forecast.

Large municipalities may be served by multiple water providers
(see also the ***Supporting Data / Water Supply - Water Providers*** map),
which are typically utilities and special districts.
Depending on location, municipalities may rely on surface water and groundwater.

## Analysis Process ##

Historical population for each municipality is estimated by DOLA for years 1980 to the year prior to the current year.
Some municipalities span multiple counties, in which case DOLA estimates the portion of a municipality's population that
exists in each county.

Forecasted population for each municipality is **not** estimated by DOLA in a public dataset.
Consequently, the forecasted population for each municipality was estimated by using the fraction of population
for each municipality in a county for most recent historical year and prorating the forecasted county
population using the same fraction.  Consequently, the relative proportion of municipalities within
a county are estimated to remain the same into the future.
Municipalities that exist in more than one county have population forecast estimated for each county part and then the
parts are added to estimate the municipality total forecasted population.

The difference between county total population and sum of municipality population within a county is
unincorporated county population.

## Other Scenarios ##

Specific scenarios may be implemented in the future where more informed municipal population is specified,
for example using Denver Regional Council of Governments or municipality data.
