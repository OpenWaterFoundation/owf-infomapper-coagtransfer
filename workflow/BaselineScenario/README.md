# workflow / BaselineScenario

This folder contains workflow steps that are executed to create the ***Baseline Scenario***
folders of the website.

Workflow steps are included here for information products that are automated using TSTool and GeoProcessor.
Most of the analysis processing occurs in the `workflow-v1` folder,
which includes TSTool command files and R scripts.
Results of the analysis are processed into information products using workflows in this folder
in order to publish the results.
