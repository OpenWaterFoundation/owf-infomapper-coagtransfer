## Background

The Municipality Population map provides population information about Colorado municipalities.
Click on a municipality marker and then view its estimated historical population
and population forecast.

Large municipalities may be served by multiple water providers
(see also the ***Supporting Data / Water Supply - Water Providers*** map),
which are typically utilities and special districts.
Depending on location, municipalities may rely on surface water and groundwater.
