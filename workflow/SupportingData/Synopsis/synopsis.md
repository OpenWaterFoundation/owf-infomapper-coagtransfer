# Supporting Data / Synopsis 

Supporting data provide foundational datasets for the analysis.
Supporting data may reflect some processing.
However, the goal is to retain a version of the data that is as close to the original source as possible
and only create derived versions of a dataset in the analysis scenarios.
Original data may be reformatted to streamline processing and visualization.

The following table lists supporting datasets.
Each ***Supporting Data*** menu item corresponds to results for the analysis step.


| **Dataset** | **Description** | **Important Assumptions and Estimates** |
| -- | -- | -- |
| ***Synopsis*** | This description.<br>[See repository for workflow files.](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer/tree/master/workflow/SupportingData/Synopsis) | |
| ***Administration - CO DWR Water Districts*** | Water decisions in Colorado must adhere to Colorado water law.  The Division of Water Resources (DWR) performs administration according to water laws and statutes.  It is important that analysis is performed within this legal framework.  Water divisions and districts provide spatial context for datasets from DWR and Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS).<br>[See repository for workflow files](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer/tree/master/workflow/SupportingData/Administration-CoDwrWaterDistricts). | |
| ***Political - Counties*** | County historical estimated and forecast population are the driving input for the analysis.  Population is used to estimate growth in municipal land use and water demands.<br>[See repository for workflow files](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer/tree/master/workflow/SupportingData/Political-Counties). | Annual county population data from Department of Local Affairs (DOLA) is the best available county population data. |
| ***Agriculture - Irrigated Lands (raster - FAST)*** | Irrigated land pacels from CDSS (see next item) are converted to raster layer with cell size of approximately 40 acres to allow a raster analysis.<br>[See repository for workflow files](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer/tree/master/workflow/SupportingData/Agriculture-IrrigatedLandsRaster). | CDSS irrigated lands as a raster is a good estimate of irrigated lands for analysis.  The raster layer allows the web application to be more responsive to user interactions. |
| ***Agriculture - Irrigated Lands (parcels - SLOW)*** | Irrigated land pacels from CDSS are the source data that are used to create the corresponding raster layer.<br>[See repository for workflow files](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer/tree/master/workflow/SupportingData/Agriculture-IrrigatedLands). | The State has invested significant resources in CDSS datasets to identify irrigated lands for water supply planning and are a good source of data. |
| ***Municipal - Municipalities*** | Municipality historical estimated population from DOLA forms the basis of forecasted population.  [See repository for workflow files](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer/tree/master/workflow/SupportingData/Municipal-Municipalities). | Annual municipal historical population data from DOLA is the best available municipal historical data. |
| ***Water Supply - Water Providers*** | Water provider service area boundaries overlap developed and undeveloped areas within municipal growth management areas and unincorporated county lands.  Municipal growth into these service areas potentially results in conversion of agricultural land into developed land and transfer of water to meet municipal demand.  [See repository for workflow files](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer/tree/master/workflow/SupportingData/WaterSupply-WaterProviders). | Water district boundaries from DOLA are the best available source of data, other than cases where data can be obtained from the water provider. |
| ***Agriculture - Conservation Easements*** | **Potential future enhancement.** Conservation easements on agricultural lands provide an additional level of protection against developing the lands.  Information about conservation easements may be private or public.  This website does not currently provide a map showing conservation easements. | Adding conservation easement data to the analysis would further constrain agricultural transfer to undeveloped lands that are not protected by a conservation easement. |
| ***Environment - Open Lands*** | **Potential future enhancement.** Open lands such as open space buffers between communities are considered in the Land Development layer (see ***Municipal - Municipalities*** map).  This website does not currently provide a map that separately shows open lands. | Open lands are included in the Land Development layer by considering public lands as undevelopable. |
| ***Municipal - Water Dedication Policies*** | **Potential future enhancement.** Raw waster supply dedication policies can play a significant role in agricultural water transfer, in particular if a water provider prefers that developers dedicate water rights to the water provider rather than providing cash in lieu of water rights. Water dedication policy information is currently not included in this website.<br>[See repository for workflow files](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer/tree/master/workflow/SupportingData/Municipal-WaterDedicationPolicies).| The water dedication policy for a water provider may increase the likelihood of agricultural water transfer to meet the water provider's demand. |
| ***Municipal - Water Rental Programs*** | **Potential future enhancement.** A water provider that operates a water rental program may cause fewer negative impacts to nearby agriculture. <br>[See repository for workflow files](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer/tree/master/workflow/SupportingData/Municipal-WaterRentals). | Considering how water rental programs impact agricultural transfers would provide additional insight in the analysis. | 
| ***Water Transfer - Case Studies*** | **Potential future enhancement.** Water transfer case studies can provide insight into alternatives to "buy and dry" of irrigated agricultural lands. <br>[See repository for workflow files](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-coagtransfer/tree/master/workflow/SupportingData/WaterTransfer-CaseStudies). | Providing spatially-referenced examples in this website would provide useful information. | 
| ***Water Transfer - Interruptible Supply Aggrements*** | **Potential future enhancement.**  Interruptible supply agreements allow agricultural water to be transferred to a municipal water provider in certain years if conditions are met, essentially providing a water supply insurance policy. | Providing examples in this website would provide useful information. | 
| ***Water Transfer - Substitute Water Supply Plans*** | **Potential future enhancement.**  Substitute water supply plans provide a mechanism to provide water supply for specific short-term needs. This approach does not provide a long-term supply but can help in certain situations. | Publishing the State's substitute water supply plan dataset in this website would provide useful information. |
