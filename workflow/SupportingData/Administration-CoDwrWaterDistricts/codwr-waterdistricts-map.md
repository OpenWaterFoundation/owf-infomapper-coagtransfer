## Background

The CO DWR Water Districts map shows basins used for water administration carried out by
the Colorado Division of Water Resources (DWR).
Decisions about water in Colorado invariably involve water rights and their administration.
A water right is appropriated for a beneficial use of water,
such as agriculture, municipal, industrial, and environmental use.
A water right decree indicates the use type, amount allocated to the use, point of diversion,
and timing of the use.
