## Introduction ##

The ***Historical Data / Irrigated Lands*** map indicates irrigated lands for various historical years.

## Update Frequency ##

This product is updated infrequently, based on changes in CDSS irrigated lands.

## Datasets ##

The following are datasets for the map.

| **Dataset** | **Description** | **Data Source** |
| -- | -- | -- |
| CDSS Irrigated Lands (2015) | CDSS irrigated lands. | The data is originally from Division 5 layer downloaded from the [State of Colorado CDSS website](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdss/gis-data-category).  It was then processed by OWF to split into water district extent and is available on the [CDSS Spatial Datasets for Colorado Water Districts and Divisions](http://data.openwaterfoundation.org/co/cdss-data-spatial-bybasin/) website.  **The OWF dataset is older and uses the original GeoJSON specification.  The workflow reads the old GeoJSON and writes in latest specification.** |
| Similar for other years | | |
