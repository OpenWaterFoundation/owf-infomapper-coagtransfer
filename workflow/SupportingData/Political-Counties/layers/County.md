# Layer: Colorado Counties (Raster)

The Colorado Counties (Raster) layer is a raster (image) created
by converting the municipality polygon boundaries layer into a raster for the analysis area.
The integer value for each cell corresponds to a county.
This raster layer is used to in the analysis when processing county-related data.

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this layer:

| **Resource** | **Source** |
