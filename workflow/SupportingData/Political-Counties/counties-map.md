## Background

The Colorado Counties map provides information about Colorado counties related to the Poudre Basin,
focusing on water resources.

## Population Data

County population data are provided by the Colorado Department of Local Affairs (DOLA)
and specifically the State Demographer's Office (SDO).
Links to data, maps, and documents explaining the approach for population estimates and forecasts
can be found on the following web pages,
including total population and subsets for sex, race, age, etc.
The total population estimates (for historical data) and forecasts
were downloaded and processed to gain a general understanding of population and impacts on water resources.

* [Colorado Information Marketplace, Total Population by County by Year](https://data.colorado.gov/Demographics/Total-Population-by-County-by-Year/9dd2-kw29) - used
for initial map data, but the data from above are now used
