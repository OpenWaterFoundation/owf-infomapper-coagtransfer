# Layer: Colorado Water Providers (Raster)

The Colorado Water Providers (Raster) layer is a raster (image) of land use area created
by converting the water providers polygon boundaries layer into a raster.
The integer value for each cell corresponds to a water provider, with 1 used for `None`.
The area for each water provider is the service area for the water provider.
This raster layer is used to perform the analysis of municipal growth and water supply from water providers.

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this layer:
