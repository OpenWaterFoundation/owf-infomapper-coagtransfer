#
# This file contains a list of water providers included in the Front Range analysis.
# This is a copy of the file that was used with initial WestWater Research analysis,
# with the following changes:
#
# - added these comments in header
# - added the column DOLA_LG_ID_Full, which has leading zeros to match DOLA full ID
#   (must treat as text to ensure zero is retained), needed to join with some datasets
#   without additional processing
# - added comments before water providers that are not explicitly modeled because the
#   are included in Denver Water
# - added Rye
