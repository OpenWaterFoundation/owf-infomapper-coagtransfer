## Background

The Municipal Water Rentals map shows municipal water providers that have water rental programs,
which are used to provide raw water to agriculture.
Water providers, such as utilities and water districts associated with municipal supply,
often acquire agricultural water rights to ensure that future raw water supplies are available for municipal use.
In many years, the water provider's water supply is more than is needed by the water provider and raw water
can be rented (leased) back to agricultural producers.
Rental program policies and procedures vary by water provider.
The available supply is typically estimated based on snowpack, reservoir storage, and other conditions.
