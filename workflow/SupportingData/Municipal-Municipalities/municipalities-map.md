## Background

The Colorado Municipalities map provides information about Colorado municipalities,
focusing on water resources.

Large municipalities may be served by multiple water providers
(see also the ***Supporting Data / Water Supply - Water Providers*** map),
which are typically utilities and special districts.
Depending on location, municipalities may rely on surface water and groundwater.
