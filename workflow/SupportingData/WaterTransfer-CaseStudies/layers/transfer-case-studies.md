# Layer: Transfer Case Studies

The Transfer Case Studies layer indicates locations where an
agricultural water transfer to other uses has occurred,
while attempting to preserve some level agriculture.
These case studies illustrate examples that may be appropriate in some form in other locations.

**The analysis presented on this web site did not consider using ATMs to meet urban water demand.**
