## Background

The Municipal Water Dedication Policies map indicates the type of dedication policy that is
used by water providers when requiring new water supply from land developers.
Dedication general occurs by the following approaches:

1. Water right dedication, for example in cases where increasing the size of the water providers
water right portfolio is important.
Agricultural use water rights may be transferred in various ways, such as:
    1. municipal area grows onto agricultural land
    2. agricultural lands at a distance from the municipal area transfer water rights from agriculture
    to municipal water provider, with land undergoing "buy and dry"
    3. agricultural land water rights purchased using "buy and supply" (water provider owns water and
    leases back to agriculture)
    4. other arrangements
2. Cash in lieu of water rights, for example in cases where:
    1. the water provider prefers to purchase water rights themselves
    (such as when a ditch has limited options to sell rights to other water providers)
    2. the water provider has a sufficient water rights portfolio for supply but
    needs cash to invest in infrastructure such as new storage reservoir
